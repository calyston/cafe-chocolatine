Cafe Chocolatine is a mock cafe single page website. This is my own design made with Adobe XD.

HTML, CSS, GIT.

## Personal Learnings

This project was my first time designing a website, and I used Adobe XD to create the design. I created a moodboard of various restaurant designs on Behance, and used them to inspire my own design. Whilst building the website, I changed the colours slightly to make the web page more vibrant and reduced the empty space in the about section. In the future I intend to improve my design and Adobe XD skills in order to avoid making changes whilst building the website. I also did not make a responsive version of my design as it was my first attempt, but since I feel this personal project went well I will aim to do so in the future.
